!! CHARACTER
!! OS shells typically process quoted strings and remove one level of quoting
!! This parser knows if a value is supposed to be a string because the 
!! prototype definition requires a string be supplied with double quotes when
!! defined. So it the string the program gets does not have its first character
!! as a double-quote the entire string is quoted. But if not, it leaves the
!! string as-is and assumes it is suitable for use as NAMELIST input. so to
!! pass an array of string values you need to enter something like:
!!
!!    ./demo7 -arr '"ONE","TWO","THREE"'
!!
!! unless the NOQUOTE=.TRUE. is used, in which case a list of words with no
!! spaces or commas can simply be
!!
!!    ./demo7 -arr ONE,TWO,THREE
!!
!! for single values if you pass in the double-quotes make sure you follow the
!! NAMELIST rules. For example, both of these should set X to A"B 
!!
!!    ./demo7 -x 'A"B'
!!    ./demo7 -x '"A""B"' ! you supplies the quotes so internal double-quotes are doubled
!!
!! Since NAMELIST requires CHARACTER variables to be allocated, you must declare the
!! variables of sufficient length or the values will be truncated.
