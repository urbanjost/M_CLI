<p>
  One drawback of a NAMELIST is it cannot contain variables not in
  the NAMELIST group. Sometimes this is acceptable because the variables
  can be logically broken into multiple NAMELIST groups. Some programs
  might only read one. Others might read all of them. That way, programs
  can avoid declaring all the variables in a single NAMELIST group and
  having to declare a lot of unused variables.
